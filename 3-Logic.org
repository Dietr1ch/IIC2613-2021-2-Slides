*** Introduction
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - We have been looking at ways to solve problems that we can encode as
      state graphs with actions describing how the world operates.
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      - Good. Algorithms can treat problems as a black box and solve many
        different problems.
      - Bad. Algorithms have little context.
        #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
        - Heuristics help giving algorithms understanding, but in a limited way.

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Essentially we used a solver for optimal paths or decisions, and we handed
    it problems we wanted to solve optimally or approximately.

*** Answer set programming - A simple example
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Program
      #+begin_src pasp
      % Cats are animals. X is an animal if X is a cat.
      animal(X) :- cat(X).  % ~X~ is a /Variable/

      % ~tom~ is a cat.
      cat(tom).  % ~tom~ is an /atom/ (constant).

        % Cats and dogs are mammals
        mammal(X) :- cat(X).
        mammal(X) :- dog(X).

        % Mammals are animals
        animal(X) :- mammal(XY).

*** Answer set programming - What is it?
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - "Programming" as in "Linear Programming".
    - A declarative problem-solving method based on logic.
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      - Has a very expressive language for modeling.
      - Has very efficient solvers. Handling tens of millions of variables.
        #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
        - Enough for exploring $2^{10\,000\,000}$ states.

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    How large is $2^{10\,000\,000}$?
    #+END_NOTES
    #+LaTeX: }

*** Modeling
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Programming
      #+begin_src dot :file Graphs/programming_workflow.png :results show :exports results
        digraph problem_solving {
          rankdir=LR;

          Problem -> Program [label="Programming"]
          Program -> Output [label="Execution"]
          Output -> Solution [label="Interpretation"]
        }
      #+end_src

    - Modeling
      #+begin_src dot :file Graphs/modeling_workflow.png :results show :exports results
        digraph problem_solving {
          rankdir=LR;

          Problem -> Model [label="Modeling"]
          Model -> Output [label="Solving"]
          Output -> Solution [label="Interpretation"]
        }
      #+end_src

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Classical programming has too many responsibilities.
    It fuses modeling with how to solve problems
    If we are also tasked with solving the problem on top of modeling it, it
    will be harder and likely our solution won't be ideal on approach and
    also implementation.
    #+END_NOTES
    #+LaTeX: }

*** Modeling - Why?
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Solvers encapsulate a really complex part of problem-solving.
    - Many concerns are kept away from our models
      - Correctness
        - Writing and proving correct software is hard. Let's re-use the effort.
      - Efficiency
        - Right approach, implementation and build need fine-tuning.

*** Modeling
    [[https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course/releases/download/v1.3.1/modeling.pdf][Potsdam's ASP collection Modeling]] (56/112)

*** The ASP Language - Simple Rules
    [[https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/course/releases/download/v1.6.1/introduction.pdf][Potsdam's ASP collection Introduction]] (42/203) ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9oiyabH6yo&list=PL7DBaibuDD9NWhREiceTokOiY-S3nertB&index=9][Class Video]]).

    The language can express various kinds of rules,
    #+begin_src pasp
      % Facts.
      p(0).    % "p(0)"
      odd(2).  % "2 is odd"

      % Rules.
      p(X) :- q(X).      % "q(X) then/implies p(X)"
      r(X) :- not s(X).  % "not s(X) then/implies r(X)"

      even(N) :- N/2 + N/2 == N.
      odd(N) :- not even(N).

      % Restrictions (aka. Integrity Constraints).
      :- p(X), q(X).  % "(p(X) and q(X)) does not hold"
    #+end_src

*** The ASP Language - More Rules
    #+begin_src pasp
      % Disjunction.
      p(X); q(X).          % "p(X) or q(X)"
      p(X); q(X) :- r(X).  %  "r(X) then/implies (p(X) or q(X))"

      % Conditionals.
      p(X) :- q(X) : r(X).  % "(q(X) if r(X)) then/implies p(X)"
                            % eq to `p(X) :- q(X), r(X)`, but easier to evaluate

      % Choice rules
      { p(X) : q(X) } = 1 :- r(X).  % "when r(X), then choose exactly 1 p(X)"
      2 { p(X) : q(X) } 5 :- r(X).  % "when r(X), then choose between 2 and 7
                                    % p(X) among those Xs that satisfy q(X)"

      % Aggregate rules.
      buy(X) :- 2 #sum{ C : useful(X), cost(X, C) } 5.
    #+end_src

*** The ASP Language - Solver options
    The language can also specify how the solver should evaluate the solutions.
    #+begin_src pasp
      % Objective specification
      % =======================
      % Interesting when solving more complicated problems

      % Weak constraints.
      :~ p(X), q(X). [X@42].  % "(p(X) and q(X)) should not hold, it would cost 42."

      % Optimization function.
      #minimize { C : useful(X), cost(X, C) }
      #maximize { F : useful(X), flow(X, F) }
    #+end_src

*** The ASP Language - Variable pitfalls
    There's restriction on the way we can use variables.
    #+begin_src pasp
      % Avoid mistakes.
      p(X) :- q(Y).  % "q(Y) then/implies p(X)"
                     % Does this make sense at all?

      % Simplify evaluation.
      p(X) :- not q(X).  % "not q(Y) then/implies p(X)"
                         % How do we get candidate constants to evaluate the rule?
    #+end_src

*** The ASP Language - More modeling
    - Constraint satisfaction
      - Graph colouring
        - Clique
      - Traveling salesman
      - Loops

      - [[./Examples/einstein.lp][Einstein's Problem]]
    - Planning
      - STRIPS
        - Coffee robot
        - Block world

*** Clingo architecture
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - ~clingo~ uses a two-phase pipeline.
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      - Grounding: removing variables. (~gringo~)
        - Parsing, de-sugaring, and "expanding" the program into a simple one.
      - Solving. (~clasp~)

*** Wumpus world                                                   :noexport:

    [[file:Graphs/wumpus_world.png]]

    #+LaTeX: \note{
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    The Wumpus world:

    The agent can only sense the current state and move up/down/left/right.
    There's 1 Wumpus, which will kill the agent on contact.
    There's holes, which cause wind in the adjacent positions.
    The Wumpus can be smelled from adjacent positions.

    How to explore this world safely and gather the gold?

*** Wumpus world - Uncertainty                                     :noexport:
    - The Wumpus world reveals how we think about uncertainty.
      - Most of the time we only know cells may have a Wumpus or a Hole.
      - As we learn we trim inconsistent ideas of the world's state.
      - And we assume the world is mostly-stable.

*** Negation types                                                 :noexport:
    - Closed world assumption.
      - What's not known to be true must be false.
        - Either $p$ is true, or $\neg p$ is true.
      - Simple, but insufficient for reasoning with incomplete information.
    - Open world assumption.
      - What's not known to be true may be still true or false.
      - Negation as failure.
        - A form of weak negation (not proved).
        - Failure to prove $p$ means $\mathrm{not}~p$ is true.
      - Non-monotonic reasoning
